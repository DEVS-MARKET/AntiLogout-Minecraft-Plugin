# Messages Settings
# Placeholders: %player% - name of the player who left the game during the fight (only for: player-quit)
# To get gradient/colored text use the formatting provided by MiniMessages (It is not possible to use legacy format here)
#
# Documentation: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html
# The reason for using multiple formatting is the lack of MiniMessages support for bossbars/items/gui,
# the basic config contains examples of using MiniMessages, follow this if you don't understand the documentation
#
# By adding subsequent lines, the chat will display all lines added to a given value
# Example:
# fight-info-player:
#   - "Line 1"
#   - "Line 2"
# You will see these 2 lines ("Line 1" and "Line 2" will appear on chat)
#
# The text that the player will see after start fighting
fight-info-player:
  - "<#636363>[<gradient:#FB0000:#FD3F3F><b>ANTILOGOUT</b></gradient><#636363>] <#9B9B9B>You are now in the middle of a fight, if you log out you will <#FB0000>die<#9B9B9B>!"
